# How to destroy a phone

Shredding data with software cannot always be trusted.
Sometimes data can be recovered despite the shredding, and sometimes data isn't overwritten when you think it is.

Here's how to physically destroy a phone to make it as close to impossible as is possible to read your data!
Keep in mind that each of these parts may be recoverable with specialized tools despite physical damage.
The more you destroy them, the better your odds.

## WARNING

Don't fuck with the battery. That shit's dangerous. Get it out before anything else.

## SD card

Destroying this will be most effective if you can open up the card to expose the internal chip.
Then just do whatever you can to destroy it. Some fun ideas are:
- drill through it
- throw it in a fire
- microwave it
- smash it with a hammer

## SIM card

Physically destroy this as much as you can. Cutting, smashing, shredding, etc. are all good options.

## Flash storage

You can probably find a diagram of the internals of your phone online. Find the labelled flash storage and drill through it.
Do more if you want. As stated above, the more destroyed the better.

## RAM

Again, this can be located with a diagram from the internet.
RAM isn't supposed to last once the phone goes off, but sometimes there's some residual charge which can be read with specialized equipment. Destroy this too.
