# Period Safe

Especially with the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade, period tracking data carries a privacy risk.
The goal of this app is to provide period tracking services without compromising privacy. It will
provide data shredding, encryption, and NO remote storage.

## why foss? (even ignoring ethical reasons why all software should be free)

Privacy should be verifiable. Without access to source code, that isn't possible. Additionally, if
people don't have the right to modify the program, it can much more easily go to shit.

## why free (as in beer)?

Private medical services are a human right. They shouldn't be behind a paywall. Unless I give away
the project (and hopefully even then) there will NEVER be any features locked behind ads or payment.
At some point, I might take donations. I might also add ads, but keep in mind they will be optional
and turned off by default. If I do this, revenue will be used to advertise the app, donated to
charities, or paid to contributors.
